1. At the start Pico walking has coordinates (-210, -120)
2. At the start Pico walking has direction 90
3. At the start the global variable gravity is -4
4. If Pico walking is not touching the color [0, 63, 255] or the color [255, 0, 191] the y coordinate is change by gravity
5. When space is pressed and Pico walking is touching the color [0, 63, 255] the global variable jump height is set to 10
6. After jump height was set to 10 it decreases by 0.5 until it reaches 0
7. After jump height was set to 10 Pico walking y coordinate changes by the current jump height
8. If Ball or Laser touches Pico walking, Pico walking is reset to starting conditions and jump height is set to 0
9. If the right arrow key is pressed Pico walking has direction 90
10. If the left arrow key is pressed Pico walking has direction -90
11. If an arrow key is pressed Pico walking moves 3 steps
12. If an arrow key is pressed Pico walking cycles through its costumes
13. If Pico walking touches the color [255, 0, 191] and the up arrow is pressed the y coordinate of Pico walking increases by 4
