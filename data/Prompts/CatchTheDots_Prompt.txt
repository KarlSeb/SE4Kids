1. At start red, yellow and blue are invisible
2. At start the global variable score is set to 0
3. At start the global variable lives is set to 3
4. At start the global variable delay is set to 8
5. Every 10 seconds delay is decreased by 0.5
6. delay does not go under 2
7. If right arrow is pressed red3roller turns right in increments 3 degrees
8. If left arrow is pressed red3roller turns left in increments of 3 degrees
9. 2 seconds after program start red creates a clone
10. Afterwards every delay seconds another clone of red is created
11. 4 seconds after program start yellow creates a clone
12. Afterwards every delay seconds another clone of yellow is created
13. 6 seconds after program start blue creates a clone
14. Afterwards every delay seconds another clone of blue is created
15. Each clone picks randomly the first or second item on the global 'start positions' list for both the x and y coordinate
16. Each clone directions points towards the red3roller
17. Each existing clone starts visible
18. Each clone moves towards red3roller until it touches red3roller
19. After a clone touches red3roller it is deleted
20. Then if red touches the color [255, 0, 0] score is increased by 1, else lives is decreased by 1
21. Then if yellow touches the color [255, 255, 0] score is increased by 1, else lives is decreased by 1
22. Then if blue touches the color [0, 63, 255] score is increased by 1, else lives is decreased by 1
23. When lives reaches 0 the game ends
24. If score is higher than the global variable highscore, highscore is set to score
