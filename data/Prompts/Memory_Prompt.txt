1. At the start the global variable score is 3
2. Until the Game Over routine happens the following routine repeats:
    - The list 'sequence is emptied
    - Until score items are in the 'sequence' list a random number between 1 and 4 is generated and Ballerina changes costume to the index of the generated number
    - When the list is empty score is increased by 1
    - When the list is empty the stage changes color effect by 25 40 times before clearing all effects
3. If red is clicked and the first item in 'sequence' is 1 the item is removed from the list, else the Game Over routine happens
4. If blue is clicked and the first item in 'sequence' is 2 the item is removed from the list, else the Game Over routine happens
5. If green is clicked and the first item in 'sequence' is 3 the item is removed from the list, else the Game Over routine happens
6. If yellow is clicked and the first item in 'sequence' is 4 the item is removed from the list, else the Game Over routine happens
7. The Game Over routine consist of the following steps:
    - Ballerina says 'Game over!' for 1 second
    - If score is bigger than the global variable high score then high score is set to the value of score
    - If score is bigger than high score Ballerina asks 'High Score! What is your name?'
    - If score is bigger than high score and the question was answered, global variable name is set to the answer
    - Afterwards the game ends
