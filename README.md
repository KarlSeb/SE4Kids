# Generating Whisker Tests using Large Language Models

This repository contains the scripts and data used to for the paper
'Generating Whisker Tests using Large Language Models' written for the
Seminar 'Software Engineering for Kids'.

The scripts in this repository rely on the Whisker framework developed at the Chair of Software Engineering II of the University of Passau which can be found here: <https://github.com/se2p/whisker>

The sample solutions for Code Clubs Scratch Projects are available on their website at: <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub>

The structure of this repository is as follows:
```
.
├── JsonProcessing.py: Script used to extract the JavaScript code from the LLM response
├── TestGenerator.py: Script to automate the generation of Tests using OpenAI's GPT
├── WhiskerRunner.py: Script to automate calls to Whisker to run or generate Tests and collecting the processes output
├── data: Contains all the data used in the writing process of the paper
│   ├── Prompts: Contains all the prompts used for generating tests using OpenAI's GPT
│   ├── Results: Contains the collected results of the test runs
